# Interfacing-with-GPIO-Pins-on-STM32F4-LED-Controls

Through this project i was able to learn multiple concepts like, 
How to code a STM32F4 DISCOVERY Board to make a LED Blink using Embedded C Programming.
How to study the architecture of a MCU.
How does pointers help in manipulating the state of LED or any other devices.                                                          
I was also able to learn Bit Manipulation and many more new concepts.
