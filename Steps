There are mainly 5 Steps to interface with  GPIO pin.

1. Identify the GPOI port (a perifheral) used to connect the LED
  a. let's suppose we have taken port D [GPIOD]
2. Identify the Pin where the LED is connected 
  a. Pin_no 12 (PD12)
3. Activate GPIOD peripheral (Enable the Clock)
  a. It is very impoertant Step to enable the clock.
  b. until the peripheral clock is not enabled the Peripheral is DEAD.
  c. Once activated, the Peripheral is ready to take your configuration or argument.
4. Configure the GPIO pin mode as output.
  a. since Driving the LED status (ON/OFF), the operation mode of the GPIO pin has to be configured as OUTPUT.
5. Write to the GPIO pin
  a. 1(HIGH) to make the GPIO pin state as HIGH(3.3V)
  b. 0(LOW) to make the GPIO pin state LOW(0V)
